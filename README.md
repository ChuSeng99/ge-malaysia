# General Election Data Analysis

This project explores election data of Malaysia across three terms (GE12, GE13, and GE14) using Python. 

## Data Source
The election dataset used in this project was obtained from https://github.com/Thevesh/data/tree/main/election_malaysia. 100% credit to the author for collating the data from Malaysia Election Commission.

The dataset contains election results for different states and seats. 
Each row represents a seat's election outcome, with columns including total votes, 
majority votes, absentee voters, and spoiled votes.
